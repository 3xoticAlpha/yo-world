### TimeTablePython
I literally copied this from random user, I dunno how to make pull request :p. Although, this has been optimized for Python 3.

Just something to check my TimeTable when I'm on my laptop and can't use the phone app

Similar to https://github.com/akhilnarang/TimeTable, except this automattically detects the day
